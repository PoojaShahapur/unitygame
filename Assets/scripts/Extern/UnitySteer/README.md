# UnitySteer 3.0 beta


## General notes

UnitySteer is a toolkit to help build steering behaviors for autonomous agents in Unity.  Initially based on OpenSteer, UnitySteer has been significantly reworked since it was first translated - the concepts and some of the code remain the same, but it follows a more Unity-like component-oriented philosophy. 

Please read License.txt before using in your projects.  It's short, sweet and to the point.

You are currently looking at UnitySteer 3.0 beta 5.  This will likely be the last beta release before moving on to RC1. I donâ€™t expect there are any new breaking changes that will make it into the codebase.


## Main repository

If you have obtained this library from a third party, [you can always find the latest version on Github](https://github.com/ricardojmendez/UnitySteer).

## Tutorials and examples

Looking for a UnitySteer tutorial?  The [UnitySteer Examples](https://github.com/ricardojmendez/UnitySteerExamples) repository contains a series of examples and experimentation notes for you to teach yourself the library basics and how to compose your own agents.

## Dependencies

UnitySteer uses [TickedPriorityQueue](https://github.com/Garufortho/TickedPriorityQueue). The latest library is now included on this repository.

## Stable and beta versions

While the current development branch is still a beta, it contains a significant number of improvements and fixes over 2.7, so I strongly suggest you start any new developments using the latest beta.

There are several breaking changes in properties and behavior from UnitySteer 2.x, so make sure you catch up with [the latest UnitySteer blogposts](http://arges-systems.com/blog/category/unitysteer/), as well as reading the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md), to be aware of what these are.

I develop UnitySteer following git-flow, so if you're looking for a specific version, you can look at the project tags:

* [UnitySteer 3.0 beta 4](https://github.com/ricardojmendez/UnitySteer/tree/v3.0.0-beta-4)
* [UnitySteer 2.7](https://github.com/ricardojmendez/UnitySteer/tree/v2.7)


## UnitySteer and iOS

If you are using UnitySteer on iOS, bear in mind that you may need to search for and change any LINQ calls, since Unity has a penchant for not AOT'ing them properly.
